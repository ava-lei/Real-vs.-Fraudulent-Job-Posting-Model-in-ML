# Real-vs.-Fraudulent-Job-Posting-Model-in-ML

The first step of people finding jobs is looking for job postings, either online or offline. With the emergence of the Internet and several platforms (e.g. Scouted, Jora, Indeed), job seekers have more access to free, available job postings. However, this convenience meanwhile increases the risk of encountering fraudulent postings, harming privacy and security. This piece uses job posting dataset to build, optimize, and evalute the model to identify real/fraudulent job postings and involves machine learning and modeling.

More specific details are explained in the PDF document of this repository.
